# Plant Performance Technical Report

## Overview

This technical document analyzes the performance metrics of the solar photovoltaic (PV) plant, providing key indicators to evaluate operational efficiency and energy production.

## Theory and Calculation Formulas

### Solar Energy Fundamentals

Solar PV systems convert solar irradiance into electrical energy. The theoretical maximum energy production depends on:

- Solar irradiance (kWh/m²)
- Panel efficiency (%)
- Total panel area (m²)
- System losses

## Performance Metrics

### Capacity Factor

**Current Value: 25.4%**

The capacity factor represents the ratio of actual energy output over a period to the maximum possible output if the plant operated at full nameplate capacity continuously.

**Formula:**

```
Capacity Factor = (Energy Generated (kWh) / (Nameplate Capacity (kW) × Time Period (hours))) × 100%
```

The current value of 25.4% is within the typical range for solar PV installations, which generally fall between 15-30% depending on location and technology.

### Performance Ratio (PR)

**Current Value: 0.98**

The Performance Ratio quantifies the relationship between actual energy output and the theoretical output calculated based on irradiance measured at the plant location.

**Formula:**

```
PR = Actual Energy Output (kWh) / (Solar Irradiance (kWh/m²) × Panel Area (m²) × Panel Efficiency)
```

**Interpretation:**

- Current PR (0.98) indicates near-optimal system performance
- Typical expected range: 0.8-0.9 per PVsyst standards
- Values approaching 1.0 represent systems with minimal losses

### Energy Generation

| Metric           | Value    |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| Daily Generation | 18.7 kWh |
| Monthly Average  | 499 kWh  |
| Peak Power       | 5 kW     |

**Daily Energy Calculation:**

```
Daily Energy (kWh) = ∫ Power(t) dt
```

Where Power(t) is the instantaneous power output at time t.

### Environmental Impact

**CO₂ Emissions Avoided: 12.4 kg/day**

This represents the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions that would have been produced if the same amount of electricity were generated using conventional fossil fuel sources.

**Formula:**

```
CO₂ Avoided (kg) = Energy Generated (kWh) × Grid Emission Factor (kg CO₂/kWh)
```

Typical grid emission factors range from 0.4 to 0.9 kg CO₂/kWh depending on the region's energy mix.

## Conclusion

The plant is performing exceptionally well with a Performance Ratio of 0.98, exceeding typical industry expectations. The capacity factor of 25.4% is solid for a solar installation, and the system is making a positive environmental impact by avoiding 12.4 kg of CO₂ emissions daily.

## Recommendations

1. Continue monitoring PR to ensure sustained performance
2. Consider seasonal adjustments for optimization
3. Use this high-performing system as a benchmark for future installations
